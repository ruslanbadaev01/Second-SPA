In this site i was use preprocessor "sass", which made it easier for me to work with css code. The market is dominated by the markup method - "flex",which is what I had problems with.


```Part of code,for example...```
```html
<div class="flex">
        <div class="logo">
            <img src="img/Safia.svg" alt=""/>
        </div>
        <div>
            <button class="button1">Login</button>
        </div>
    </div>
```
### Buttons
Animation buttons don't have, I'm working on it now.

### Optimization
I can't say that the code is fully optimized, however, I tried to write it as short and profitable as possible. In general, the code took 600-700 lines
